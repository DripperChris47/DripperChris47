Chris, a 22-year-old mass communication student in his second year at Egerton University, has achieved remarkable success as the founder of Chris Outfits Thrift Stores. His entrepreneurial journey began with a small shop in Kisumu, where his passion for high-quality fashion quickly garnered a loyal customer base.
Chris's dedication and vision led him to expand his business, opening additional stores in Nakuru, Naivasha, and most recently, Mombasa. Today, Chris Outfits Thrift Stores stands as a testament to his hard work and ambition, with four thriving locations across Kenya.
Despite his impressive accomplishments, Chris remains humble about his financial success. In a recent interview with Mungai Eve, he chose to keep his net worth private, focusing instead on the continued growth and impact of his business.
